This project is based on course "Getting and cleaning data" final project, from Coursera. 
Files used in this project are:
- 'README.md' 
- 'Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones - Data set.rar', data set with all following instructions and descriptions for goal of this project.
- 'run_analysis.R', function that should do the following: 
    	1) Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
    	2) Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
    	3) Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
    	4) Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive activity names. 
    	5) Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each 			activity and each subject. 
- 'CodeBook.md', a code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that were performed to clean up the data.
